# Hello 👋

My name is Michael Leonffu. I'm Computer Engineering graduate from
University of California, Los Angeles: UCLA. I enjoy designing, documenting,
DevOps, and writing software/programs in the backend. I currently work at
TimelyCare and I still enjoy tinkering and learning on new software in my free time.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on:
  - 🌱 I'm currently learning GoLang!
  - 🤖 `Anna Li Bot` discord bot.
  - 💻 `cookieandrock.dev` Learning Full Stack Development: Next.js,
    TailwindCSS, Strapi (CMS), Nginx (reverse proxy), MongoDB, and DevOps.

🏸 Badminton Buddy; a smart badminton birdie pitcher robot.
  - 📝 wordle, a wordle solver; it started as a small script and it got bloated.
  - 🎁 `ghost-upload`, VSCode extension to upload blog posts onto a ghost
  - 📖 Class projects/labs, some of which I may have permission to post on
    github!
- 🔭 I'm also ~~currently~~ working on `Charjabug` a reverse remote ssh tunnel,
  webserver, and gpio led on rpi zero w.
- 🌱 I'm learning reverse ssh tunnel, gpio on rpi, and makefiles
- 🤔 I'm looking for things to do with HDL and Machine Learning.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on anything with DevOps and webdev or backend
  systems!

### Developer Philosophy

Build software slowly and systematically. I've felt the pain of forgetting old
scripts and code I used to know. Every year I'd set up a raspberry pi
headlessly, and every year I'd need to look up the commands to do it. That's
when I decided to write scripts to automate the process, and take notes so I
don't forget the steps in the future.

Now I can easily open an old project and implement and new feature to it.
My next steps are to build a platform where I can host and interact with
scripts and programs I've created and used. Often times the things I write
aren't used frequently enough and become obsolete. This is my next goal.

<!--
I also use [blog.cookieandrock.dev](blog.cookieandrock.dev) as a platform for
writing certain lessons I've learned in software and tools. One day I
realized that I was relearning old material I had learned before. I didn't
like that. So I started documenting lessons learned and making some automated
tools like headless-rpi installers. I hope that with all these new ideas I can
keep working on increasing my knowledge base systematically and consistently.
