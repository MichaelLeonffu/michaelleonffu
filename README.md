# Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael Leonffu. I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at University of California, Los Angeles: UCLA. I enjoy designing, documenting, and writing software/programs specifically in backend (**EDIT**: I'm slowly learning some front-end!).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - ðŸ¤– `Anna Li Bot` discord bot. Rewriting it in python. Updating it consistantly.
  - ðŸ’» `cookieandrock.dev` Learning Full Stack Development: Next.js, TailwindCSS, Strapi (CMS), Nginx (reverse proxy), MongoDB, and DevOps.
  - ðŸ“– Class projects/labs, some of which I may have permission to post on github!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m also ~~currently~~ working on `Charjabug` a reverse remote ssh tunnel, webserver, and gpio led on rpi zero w.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning reverse ssh tunnel, gpio on rpi, and makefiles
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for things to do with HDL and Machine Learning.

As you can see I'm all over the place! My goal is to learn enough to build a skeleton/bare-bone structure
of software which I can later easily update and adapt. For example, I hope [cookieandrock.dev](cookieandrock.dev)
becomes one of those platforms.

For me, it's more valuable to be able to work on a project/service over a long period of time than having a
project be isolated. Idealy I want a small overhead of picking up an old project and working on it. I've been
trying to keep this in mind while making new projects so that later I can reuse or interconnect them together
as smaller modules/software for a larger purpose.
