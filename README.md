## Hi!

I am an enthusiastic **Software Engineer specializing in Backend Systems**.

I have a BS in Computer Engineering from University of California, Los Angeles UCLA.  
I currently work at [TimelyCare](https://timelycare.com) as a node.js backend engineer.

Outside of work I like to:
- Design and architect.
- Learn new technologies and algorithms.
- Administrate and DevOps.
- Document.

Most of all, I enjoy Applying what I learn to projects.

🔭 I'm currently:
- 🌱 Learning Go!
- 🌱 Practicing clear and scalabe/maintainable code.
- 🌱 Learning how to orient solutions to increase generate business value.

- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on anything with DevOps and webdev or backend
  systems!

### Developer Philosophy

- Hack myself, be consistent: build software systematically. Learning is not a sprint, it's a marathon.
- MVPs: build and itterate fast, keeping in mind the big picture.
- Know when to hack and when to use maintainable/scalable patterns.

**Why?**

It is painful. Forgetting about programs I made.
Not knowing if code I wrote works. Where I left off. etc.
For example, every year I set up a raspberry pi headlessly,
and every year I have to look up the commands to do it.

It is inefficient and I dislike repeating it.

So I decided to write scripts to automate the process,
and take notes so I understand the steps in the future.

It off quickly. In a matter of minutes, I can set up a new headless RPI!
I can open up old projects to implement a new feature and deploy immediately.

I am a backend engineer; so the next step is intuitive...
build a platform so I can host and interact with all the programs I have ever created.

<!--
I think my journey is beneficial to document. For others as well as for myself.
Keep up with the next exciting thing I'm doing on:
BLOG PAGE IS TEMPORALITY UNDER MAINTENANCE.

Often times the things I write
aren't used frequently enough and become obsolete. This is my next goal.

I also use [blog.cookieandrock.dev](blog.cookieandrock.dev) as a platform for
writing certain lessons I've learned in software and tools. One day I
realized that I was relearning old material I had learned before. I didn't
like that. So I started documenting lessons learned and making some automated
tools like headless-rpi installers. I hope that with all these new ideas I can
keep working on increasing my knowledge base systematically and consistently.
