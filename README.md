# Hello 👋

My name is Michael Leonffu. I'm Computer Engineering graduate from
University of California, Los Angeles: UCLA. I enjoy designing, documenting,
DevOps, and writing software/programs specifically in backend.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on:
  - 🤖 `Anna Li Bot` discord bot. Rewriting it in python. Updating it
    consistantly.
  - 💻 `cookieandrock.dev` Learning Full Stack Development: Next.js,
    TailwindCSS, Strapi (CMS), Nginx (reverse proxy), MongoDB, and DevOps.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on anything with DevOps and webdev or backend
  systems!

### Developer Philosophy

My philosophy is to build software slowly and systematically. I strive to
write enough documentation so that I can pick up my own projects later in the
future. I want to be able to easily open an old project and implement and new
feature to it. I'm tired of having old projects which I have to spend a lot
of time to decipher.

I also have been starting to build software which I can use as a platform for
my other services. I have [cookieandrock.dev](cookieandrock.dev) becomes one
of those platforms and when my discord bot needs to have a web interface, I
can use cookieandrock.dev as that platform. The infrastructure is built.

I also use [blog.cookieandrock.dev](blog.cookieandrock.dev) as a platform for
writing certain lessons I've learned in software and tools. One day I
realized that I was relearning old material I had learned before. I didn't
like that. So I started documenting lessons learned and making some automated
tools like headless-rpi installers. I hope that with all these new ideas I can
keep working on increasing my knowledge base systematically and consistently.
