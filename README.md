# Hiya!

I'm Computer Engineering graduate University of California, Los Angeles UCLA.
I enjoy designing, documenting, DevOps, and writing software in the backend.

I currently work at [TimelyCare](https://timelycare.com) as a backend engineer
and I enjoy tinkering with software during my free time.

🔭 I'm currently working on:
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Go by making a pet project TBD!
- 🤖 `Anna Li Bot` discord bot
- 🌱 Code cleanliness, scalability, and MVPs

<!--
  - 💻 `cookieandrock.dev` Learning Full Stack Development: Next.js,
    TailwindCSS, Strapi (CMS), Nginx (reverse proxy), MongoDB, and DevOps.
🏸 Badminton Buddy; a smart badminton birdie pitcher robot.
  - 📝 wordle, a wordle solver; it started as a small script and it got bloated.
  - 🎁 `ghost-upload`, VSCode extension to upload blog posts onto a ghost
  - 📖 Class projects/labs, some of which I may have permission to post on
    github!
- 🔭 I'm also ~~currently~~ working on `Charjabug` a reverse remote ssh tunnel,
  webserver, and gpio led on rpi zero w.
- 🌱 I'm learning reverse ssh tunnel, gpio on rpi, and makefiles
- 🤔 I'm looking for things to do with HDL and Machine Learning.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on anything with DevOps and webdev or backend
  systems!

### Developer Philosophy

- Build software systematically.
- Build fast with MVPs.
- Don't hack, instead use maintainable and good patterns.
- Refactor as needed.

**Why?**

It's painful. Forgetting scripts and code I used to know.
Each year I'd set up a raspberry pi headlessly, and each year I'd
look up the commands to do it.

I dislike inefficiency and detest repeating mistakes.

That is when I decided to write scripts to automate the process, and
take notes so I don't forget the steps in the future.

The dividends paied off quickly. Setting up a new headless RPI is
done in a matter of minutes! I can open an old project, implement a
new feature, and deploy immediately.

Now I'm building a platform where I can host and interact with all my
scripts and programs I've created. I think my journey is beneficial
to document. For others as well as for myself.

Keep up with the next exciting thing I'm doing on:
BLOG PAGE IS TEMPORALITY UNDER MAINTENANCE.

<!--
Often times the things I write
aren't used frequently enough and become obsolete. This is my next goal.

I also use [blog.cookieandrock.dev](blog.cookieandrock.dev) as a platform for
writing certain lessons I've learned in software and tools. One day I
realized that I was relearning old material I had learned before. I didn't
like that. So I started documenting lessons learned and making some automated
tools like headless-rpi installers. I hope that with all these new ideas I can
keep working on increasing my knowledge base systematically and consistently.
