## Engineering Philosophy

I believe in:

- **Systematic Development**: Building software methodically with a focus on long-term maintainability
- **Fast and Iterative Progress**: Starting with MVPs and evolving based on real-world feedback
- **Driving Business Value**: Knowing when to prioritize for speed or maintainability
- **Automation First**: Automating repetitive tasks

### Why This Matters

My journey in software engineering has taught me the importance of sustainable development practices. For example, I used to spend hours manually setting up Raspberry Pi devices each year. So I wrote automation scripts, now I can set up a new headless Raspberry Pi in a few commands.

This experience shaped my view on software development. It keeps me grounded in what actually matters. It's all about solving problems with software. Too often I find myself getting stuck in optimizing for long-term maintainability, or code cleanliness. I lose sight of the actual problem I'm trying to solve. Hahaha, things were much simpler when I didn't know how to code.
